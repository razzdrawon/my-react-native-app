- Real-time device discovery with automatic timeout

### üîó Device Management
- Connect to discovered devices
- Disconnect from connected devices
- Visual connection status indicators
- Error handling and user feedback

### üì° Data Transfer
- Send text messages to connected devices
- Listen for incoming data
- Message history tracking
- Real-time connection status

## Installation

The Bluetooth functionality is already integrated into your project. The following packages have been installed:

```bash
npm install expo-bluetooth
```

## Configuration

### App Permissions

The `app.json` file has been updated with necessary Bluetooth permissions:

#### iOS
```json
"ios": {
  "infoPlist": {
    "NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription": "This app uses Bluetooth to connect to nearby devices",
    "NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription": "This app uses Bluetooth to connect to nearby devices"
  }
}
```

#### Android
```json
"android": {
  "permissions": [
    "android.permission.BLUETOOTH",
    "android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN",
    "android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN",
    "android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT",
    "android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION",
    "android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"
  ]
}
```

## Usage

### 1. Access Bluetooth Tab

Navigate to the "Bluetooth" tab in your app's bottom navigation.

### 2. Device Discovery

1. **Grant Permissions**: Tap "Grant Permissions" if Bluetooth permissions haven't been granted
2. **Start Scan**: Tap "Start Scan" to discover nearby Bluetooth devices
3. **View Devices**: Discovered devices will appear in the list with their names and signal strength
4. **Auto-stop**: Scanning automatically stops after 10 seconds

### 3. Device Connection

1. **Tap Device**: Tap on any discovered device to connect
2. **Confirm Connection**: Confirm the connection in the alert dialog
3. **Connection Status**: Connected devices show a green indicator and "(Connected)" label

### 4. Data Transfer

Switch to the "Data Transfer" tab after connecting to a device:

#### Sending Messages
1. Enter your message in the text input
2. Tap "Send" to transmit the message
3. Sent messages appear in the message history

#### Receiving Data
1. Tap "Start Listening" to begin receiving data
2. Incoming messages will appear in the message history
3. Tap "Stop Listening" to stop receiving data

## Components

### `useBluetooth` Hook
Custom React hook that manages all Bluetooth functionality:

```typescript
const {
  isEnabled,        // Bluetooth enabled status
  isScanning,       // Currently scanning for devices
  devices,          // Array of discovered devices
  connectedDevice,  // Currently connected device
  error,            // Error messages
  startScan,        // Start device discovery
  stopScan,         // Stop device discovery
  connectToDevice,  // Connect to specific device
  disconnectDevice, // Disconnect from device
  requestPermissions, // Request Bluetooth permissions
  clearError        // Clear error messages
} = useBluetooth();
```

### `BluetoothManager` Component
Manages device discovery and connections with a user-friendly interface.

### `BluetoothDataTransfer` Component
Handles data transmission and reception between connected devices.

## Bluetooth States

- **Disabled**: Bluetooth is turned off
- **Scanning**: Actively searching for nearby devices
- **Connected**: Successfully connected to a device
- **Error**: An error occurred (permissions, connection, etc.)

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Permission denials
- Bluetooth disabled
- Connection failures
- Scanning errors
- Device not found scenarios

## Best Practices

### 1. Permission Management
- Always request permissions before using Bluetooth
- Handle permission denials gracefully
- Provide clear explanations for permission requirements

### 2. Device Discovery
- Limit scan duration to conserve battery
- Clear previous results before new scans
- Handle device duplicates appropriately

### 3. Connection Management
- Always disconnect when done
- Handle connection state changes
- Provide visual feedback for connection status

### 4. Data Transfer
- Implement proper error handling for failed transmissions
- Use appropriate data formats for your use case
- Consider implementing retry mechanisms

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Bluetooth permissions not granted"**
   - Go to device settings and grant Bluetooth permissions
   - Restart the app after granting permissions

2. **"No devices found"**
   - Ensure Bluetooth is enabled on your device
   - Make sure other Bluetooth devices are discoverable
   - Try moving closer to the target device

3. **"Failed to connect"**
   - Check if the target device is available
   - Ensure the device supports the required Bluetooth profile
   - Try disconnecting and reconnecting

4. **"Bluetooth is not enabled"**
   - Enable Bluetooth in device settings
   - Restart the app after enabling Bluetooth

### Debug Information

Enable debug logging by checking the console for:
- Permission request results
- Device discovery events
- Connection attempts and results
- Error messages and stack traces

## Platform Considerations

### iOS
- Requires explicit permission requests
- Limited background Bluetooth operation
- Specific Bluetooth usage descriptions required

### Android
- More flexible permission model
- Better background operation support
- Location permissions may be required for scanning

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing these additional features:
- Device pairing and bonding
- Service and characteristic discovery
- Custom data protocols
- Background Bluetooth operation
- Device filtering and preferences
- Connection quality monitoring

## Security Notes

- Always validate received data
- Implement proper authentication for sensitive operations
- Consider encryption for data transmission
- Be aware of Bluetooth security vulnerabilities

## Support

For issues or questions about the Bluetooth implementation:
1. Check the console for error messages
2. Verify device compatibility
3. Test with different Bluetooth devices
4. Review platform-specific requirements
